### 📈 Analyses Conducted

1. **📑 Financial Analysis**
   - Performing financial ratio calculations and explaining trends, causes, and outlooks.
   
2. **📉 Technical Analysis**
   - Understanding & commenting on the past performances of each stock in the portfolio.
   
3. **📊 Covariance and Correlation Analysis**
   - Understanding & commenting on the covariance and correlation between each stock in the portfolio.
   
4. **🔮 Monte Carlo Simulation for Price Prediction**
   - Performing price predictions using Monte Carlo Simulation for each stock and commenting on their outlooks:
     - 🌟 Optimistic outlook (90th percentile)
     - 😐 Neutral outlook (50th percentile)
     - 🌧️ Pessimistic outlook (10th percentile)

5. **💵 Present and Future Value Calculations**
   - Calculating present and future values for investments.

6. **📉 Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**
   - Calculating NPV for potential investments.

7. **🌳 Decision Trees and Random Forest Analysis**
   - Analyzing the relationship between decision trees and random forests in stock analysis:
     - 👍 Pros and cons of each approach.

8. **📅 Historical Data Analysis**
   - Downloading 5-year historical data for 2 stocks and storing their adjusted close prices:
     - 📆 Calculating daily and annual returns.
     - 📊 Analyzing annual risk values and their impact on investment decisions.

9. **📈 Multiple Stocks Analysis**
   - Downloading data for 5 stocks and storing their adjusted closing prices for further analysis:
     - 📉 Calculating log returns for each stock.
     - 📆 Calculating annual portfolio return assuming equal weighting.
     - 📊 Calculating covariance and correlation matrix.
     - 📉 Calculating annual portfolio risk assuming equal weighting.

10. **⚖️ Optimally Weighted Portfolio Construction**
    - Constructing a 2-stock portfolio based on 5 years of historical adjusted close prices using Monte Carlo simulation for optimal weighting.
